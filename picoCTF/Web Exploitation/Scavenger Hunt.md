## Challenge: Scavenger Hunt 

# Challenge Description 

There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/. Can you find it?

# Solution

The first flag is easily be found in the `HTML` file when inspecting the web page source.
>!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->

While continue viewing the `css` file, the second flag is being hide under the file.
>/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */

While taking a look at the `JavaScript` file, a sentence is shown saying
>/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
<br>

We can easily check on the `robots.txt` file which is a standard where used by websites to communicate with web crawlers and other automated agents,
such as search engine bots. It is a text file that provides instructions to these bots about which areas of the website should not be crawled or indexed.

To access the next flag, it says that 
>I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?

In this case, we can view on the `.htaccess` file as it  is a configuration file used by Apache servers to define settings for a specific directory, and it can override some global server configurations.

From here, to access the next flag is says 
>I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.

We can simple view on the `.DS_Store` file as it is a specific file created by the macOS operating system to store custom attributes of a folder, 
such as the position of icons and other display settings.
