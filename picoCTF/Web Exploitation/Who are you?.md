# Solution 

When the website doesnt contain any interactive elements, we can always inspect on the webpage source. In this case, there's nothing much but a plain text saying 
>Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!

Therefore, to intercept and modify the HTTP request in order to use the official PicoBrowser we can use [BurpSuit](https://portswigger.net/burp)
