# Solution 

As the website has mentioned the sentence
>Where are the robots?

We can consider the `robots.txt` file as a textual document on a website, offering instructions to [web crawlers](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot) (robots) 
and search engine bots regarding which pages or sections of the site should be avoided during crawling and indexing.

It contains URLs accompanied by the "Disallow" directive, signaling web crawlers and search engine bots to refrain from accessing or indexing specific content. 
To explore further, we enter the specified file path for examination.
