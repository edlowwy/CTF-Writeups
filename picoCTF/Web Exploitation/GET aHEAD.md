# Challenge: GET aHEAD

## Challenge Description
Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931/

## Solution
Upon examining the elements of the webpage, it becomes apparent that two HTTP request methods are employed: "POST" for the blue element and "GET" for the red element. You can learn more about HTTP request methods [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)

<br>
Considering the title of the challenge, "GET aHEAD," it seems to suggest the use of the "HEAD" HTTP request method. 
To intercept and modify the HTTP request method, [BurpSuite](https://portswigger.net/burp) can be easily employed for this purpose. Given the hint in the title, "GET aHEAD," it becomes evident that altering the HTTP request method of the red element to "HEAD" is a plausible approach.
