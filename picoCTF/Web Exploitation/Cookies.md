# Challenge: Cookies 

## Challenge Description 
Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:21485/

## Solution
From the information found on the webpage, simply input 'snickerdoodle' into the text bar as it is 
already provided in the text. To identify the optimal cookie, navigate to the web page's application 
section and inspect the cookie storage. Initially, before entering any text into the text bar, 
the value is set to `-1` Upon entering the term 'snickerdoodle,'
>I love snickerdoodle cookies!
I observed that the value changed to `0`

Consequently, I attempted to increment the value and refresh the page. As a result, various types of cookies appeared 
on the screen until reaching the value '18,' at which point the flag became visible
