It all started by inspecting the element of the web page, as the web page seems normal. The first flag is obvious where it hides under the `HTML` file.
>!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->

Followed by viewing the second flag which lays under the `css` file.
>/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */

Lastly, the flag is easily hides under the `JavaScript` file.
>/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?2e7b23e3} */

# Flag
